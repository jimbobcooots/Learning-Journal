Journal of my experiences at Codefellows

Journal Entry 1
My first step in the process of evaluating my learning will be:

1. Making sure that I am keeping up with the course material and concepts. In the case that I feel I don't understand a concept and feel behind in the course, I will make that particular concept my main focus to master regardless of any potential desires to learn other things.

2. If I feel that I am keeping up with the course material and concepts through proficiency in my labs and familiarity with the lecture concepts, then I will gear my learning towards my interests in how I want to apply my current skills.

For example, I'd like to shape my skills towards styling and building pages related to website or app ideas that I have. What I love about coding is that it is a skill that can be applied to an idea and if I feel comfortable with my learning process, I would guide my learning based on my ideas.

In my short time of studying code I'm already learning how important it is to have great endurance of focus. I have found that lapses in focus while coding can spiral into complete confusion, and need to managed either by mindful strategy, using a peer, or taking a break. 

I think my prior academic experiences will help me through this course. I am accustomed to a rigorous curriculum as well as work that is language and proofreading intensive. I also have developed good strategies for memorization and maximization of learning, which I am applying to this experience.

Learning is a natural process of life and occurs consciously and subconsciously, so I think it is unavoidable, however, my motivations for learning fields of my choosing are for the purpose of self-development. For learning code specifically, I want to develop my professional skills to set myself up for job opportunities. I also have an interest in applying my coding skills on top of my Photoshop capabilities, or towards entrepreneurial pursuits.

My learning is progressing, though I am already starting to feel the intensity of the course. I am very grateful Allie spoke about "Impostor Syndrome" at the beginning of the class because I have felt that way ever since I began exploring coding as a possible career option for me. Though I don't feel like I am a "coder" I do enjoy the craft, and am anxious to tackle the challenges ahead. My goal for the upcoming week is to get ahead on my readings and to review the material that we go over in class so that it really gets ingrained. I also want to begin exploring options with the career counselor and narrowing down some companies I am interested in pursuing.

Journal Entry 5: Intrinsic Motivators for Learning 03/13/2018
- Advancing professional self, becoming a more valuable asset
- To be able to apply a craft to creative pursuits. Essentially, learning to give me the ability to act on my ideas. If I had an idea for an app or website I could actually go forth about making it.
- Learning is growing and helps me to evolve as a person. Even subconsciously, learning changes how one thinks and interacts with the world. It makes me feel alive.

Journal Entry 6: 03/14/2018
Today i learned how to create a form that can take value inputs and produce an output of that information. I also learned how to render functions and apply event listeners to my objects. I feel like this is just scratching the surface and I am still a couple weeks off from getting the muscle memory of getting the process down, but I am excited to be manipulating the DOM!

Journal Entry 7: What is the most unexpected part of this experience and how am I learning from it?
The most unexpected part of this experience is that I'm actually doing it. If the impostor syndrome wasn't addressed at day 1 I would be feeling much worse than I do now. The issue isn't that I don't like what I'm doing, it is 95% because I simply have never viewed myself as a programmer, "tech nerd", or "computer guy" in my entire life. I guess I am slowly learning that people can stereotype themselves and that is a way we self-limit. By assuming we can't do something or aren't a certain type of person we close doors to our possibilities.

I agree with the order of importance of the list. The only thing I would rephrase is "teaching others" because that is teaching what you already know. I would say "collaborating with others" because then people are learning from each other. I do find this the most hands-on, helpful way I have learned code so far, and really enjoy the collaboration aspect. I think learning is maximized with this method because differing ideas are being shared with the goal of reaching a common solution.

Firstly, I would like to say that I am very appreciative of CodeFellows for bringing this up at the commencement of the 201 course and continuing to focus on it throughout this process. I had no idea this feeling was common, particularly amongst people in this field and it is a relief to know that I'm not the only one who feels this. Coming into this, I'd say my impostor syndrome was a 9 out 10, now I would say it's at a 7 or an 8. I have a growth mindset, but I think my belief in my potential to be a successful programmer is still limited. This is mainly because when I think about what I career is a good fit for me, the best reference I have is to draw from my past experiences. Throughout my education and personal life I have not had a particular interest in computers nor the concepts or practice of math. Because I haven't aligned with those things in my past, I have been very unsure about my fit in the field. Having said that, I have always enjoyed creating things. I get a great amount of satisfaction from creating something and having that thing be enjoyed by someone else. And so far, I am getting that satisfaction from programming. 

Journal Entry 10: 3/19/2018
As the class has progressed I have encountered new positives and new challenges. One of the biggest positives has been an increasing eagerness to build and to design. I am inspired to do some pro-bono designing for the websites of a couple family-friends whose business sites are in need of serious makeovers. A challenge I have faced is I have gotten past the point in Javascript where the course material has been review for me, and now entering territory where everything is new, and therefore, slower to learn. I have been relying on peer programming more and more for the Javascript, which I have really enjoyed because I learn about my peers' thought processes and can use those strategies to my advantage. 

Journal Entry 11: 3/20/2018
That is a tough question. I'm pretty reflective when it comes to times when I have experienced "failure" or regret. After reflecting, my course of action is to compensate for what I perceived to be the flaws in my handling of the situation. Depending on the severity of the setback I may be very motivated to prevent a similar issue from happening again.

Journal Entry 12: 3/21/2018
One thing easier to learn than expected: javascript has expectedly been the biggest challenge for me, and I want to focus the most on understanding its concepts. However, one thing that I have noticed is though sometimes I can't solve a problem on my own, when I look at other code, I am starting to understand what it is saying. This reminds me of learning Spanish because in that process, there was a point when I couldn't say everything I wanted to say in the language, but I could understand someone else's writing in it. I feel like I am at this step in coding.

One thing harder to learn than expected: I enjoy styling pages and thought that CSS would come easily to me, but there are aspects of it I find very difficult. Namely, remembering the best formatting practices and getting the knowledge of what everything does buttoned down in my memory. I still feel like my CSS is a messy, helter skelter experiment that feels like patching together an assortment of things until they somehow look the way I want them to.

Journal 13: 3/22/2018
This week has ramped up tremendously for me in terms of difficulty. In previous weeks I didn't have to rely as heavily on TA's and demo code to get through the labs. I find myself needing that crutch more often, which isn't the best feeling, but I believe it is still a stepping stone in the learning process. I'm absorbing a lot of information, and though it has been challenging, it doesn't phase me. I'm just excited to get better at coding!
