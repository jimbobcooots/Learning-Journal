Journal of my experiences at Codefellows

Journal Entry 1
My first step in the process of evaluating my learning will be:

1. Making sure that I am keeping up with the course material and concepts. In the case that I feel I don't understand a concept and feel behind in the course, I will make that particular concept my main focus to master regardless of any potential desires to learn other things.

2. If I feel that I am keeping up with the course material and concepts through proficiency in my labs and familiarity with the lecture concepts, then I will gear my learning towards my interests in how I want to apply my current skills.

For example, I'd like to shape my skills towards styling and building pages related to website or app ideas that I have. What I love about coding is that it is a skill that can be applied to an idea and if I feel comfortable with my learning process, I would guide my learning based on my ideas.

In my short time of studying code I'm already learning how important it is to have great endurance of focus. I have found that lapses in focus while coding can spiral into complete confusion, and need to managed either by mindful strategy, using a peer, or taking a break. 

I think my prior academic experiences will help me through this course. I am accustomed to a rigorous curriculum as well as work that is language and proofreading intensive. I also have developed good strategies for memorization and maximization of learning, which I am applying to this experience.

Learning is a natural process of life and occurs consciously and subconsciously, so I think it is unavoidable, however, my motivations for learning fields of my choosing are for the purpose of self-development. For learning code specifically, I want to develop my professional skills to set myself up for job opportunities. I also have an interest in applying my coding skills on top of my Photoshop capabilities, or towards entrepreneurial pursuits.

My learning is progressing, though I am already starting to feel the intensity of the course. I am very grateful Allie spoke about "Impostor Syndrome" at the beginning of the class because I have felt that way ever since I began exploring coding as a possible career option for me. Though I don't feel like I am a "coder" I do enjoy the craft, and am anxious to tackle the challenges ahead. My goal for the upcoming week is to get ahead on my readings and to review the material that we go over in class so that it really gets ingrained. I also want to begin exploring options with the career counselor and narrowing down some companies I am interested in pursuing.

Journal Entry 5: Intrinsic Motivators for Learning 03/13/2018
- Advancing professional self, becoming a more valuable asset
- To be able to apply a craft to creative pursuits. Essentially, learning to give me the ability to act on my ideas. If I had an idea for an app or website I could actually go forth about making it.
- Learning is growing and helps me to evolve as a person. Even subconsciously, learning changes how one thinks and interacts with the world. It makes me feel alive.

Journal Entry 6: What is the most unexpected part of this experience and how am I learning from it?
The most unexpected part of this experience is that I'm actually doing it. If the impostor syndrome wasn't addressed at day 1 I would be feeling much worse than I do now. The issue isn't that I don't like what I'm doing, it is 95% because I simply have never viewed myself as a programmer, "tech nerd", or "computer guy" in my entire life. I guess I am slowly learning that people can stereotype themselves and that is a way we self-limit. By assuming we can't do something or aren't a certain type of person we close doors to our possibilities.
